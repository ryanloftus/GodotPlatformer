Information about working with the Rust library.

To build the library run `cargo build` in the `rust-lib` folder. This will build the library files into `target/debug/*.dylib`. From there, copy the library into `/Zizzle`. At this point, you should be able to run the rust code in `rust-lib/src/lib.rs`.
